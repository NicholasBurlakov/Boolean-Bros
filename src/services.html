            <h2>Our Services</h2>
            <p>ParkSmart allows users to effortlessly pay for parking or reserve spots for future use. Our user-friendly website, accessible from any mobile device, offers seamless interaction with our services.</p>
            
            <h3>User Interaction</h3>
            <p>Engagement with our services is primarily through our website designed for optimal functionality on both desktop and mobile browsers. Users can check spot availability, make payments, or reserve spaces with just a few clicks.</p>
            
            <h3>Ease of Access</h3>
            <p>Users can register on our site to store their vehicle and payment information, simplifying future interactions.</p>
            
            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <p>As we are in the initial stages of our project, the primary benefit is experiencing our developmental progress. As computer science students, this project is providing us with invaluable experience in software development. We are working towards integrating cutting-edge QR code and vehicle recognition technologies that will offer distinct advantages in the future.</p>
            
            <h3>Reservation Process</h3>
            <p>Our reservation process is straightforward: users visit our homepage, check spot availability via our parking lot search page, and select from available spots indicated by color codingâ€”green for available and orange for occupied. After selecting a spot, users can choose to pay immediately or reserve for later use. Additionally, users can log in or register directly from the homepage to expedite future transactions.</p>
            
            <h3>Payment Methods</h3>
            <p>Currently, we will just support "practice" credit card payments, focusing on the fundamental functionality as this remains a project aimed at educational and developmental purposes.</p>
            
            <h3>Innovative Features</h3>
            <p>We are actively developing innovative features like QR code scanning and vehicle recognition to enhance our service offerings and provide unique solutions in parking management.</p>
