            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>ParkSmart was founded in April 2024 with a mission to revolutionize parking through technology.</p>

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Inspired by the need for an easy and accessible way to pay for and reserve parking spots, ParkSmart was created by a group of passionate innovators. As students and emerging tech enthusiasts, we also embraced this project to gain invaluable experience in building web applications.</p>

            <h3>Team</h3>
            <p>The company was founded by Dillon, Nick, Caleb, Tyler, and Austinâ€”all coming from a strong computer science foundation acquired at Eastern Washington University.</p>

            <h3>Core Values and Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>At ParkSmart, our core values revolve around innovation, accessibility, and reliability. We are committed to transforming parking management with smart technology solutions that ensure convenience for all users.</p>

            <p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> "To innovate and streamline parking management, making it accessible and reliable for every vehicle owner."</p>

            <h3>Differentiation</h3>
            <p>Currently in development, ParkSmart plans to integrate advanced technology such as QR codes and AI-driven image recognition to monitor parking availability. This unique feature is under active development as we explore the most effective methods to serve our users better.</p>

            <h3>Achievements</h3>
            <p>A significant early success for us was developing a prototype system capable of detecting parked cars over QR codes, confirming spot availability in real-time.</p>
